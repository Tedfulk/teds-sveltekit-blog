## Introduction

If you've just installed Ollama on your computer and are excited to explore its range of models, you're in the right place. In this article, we'll take a deep dive into the Ollama Library, discuss the different types of models available, and help you make an informed choice on which model suits your needs best.

## Exploring the Ollama Library

### Sorting Models

When you visit the Ollama Library at [ollama.ai](https://ollama.ai/library?sort=featured), you'll see a comprehensive list of available models. To make your search easier, you can sort this list using different parameters:

- **Featured**: Showcases the models recommended by the Ollama team as the best choices for most users.
- **Most Popular**: Ranks the models based on recent download numbers.
- **Most Recent**: Lets you explore the latest additions to the library.

### Exploring Tags

Each model in the Ollama Library comes with various tags that give you specific information about its functionality. These tags appear after the colon in the model's name. Here are some key points about tags:

- The "latest" tag usually indicates the most popular variation, not necessarily the newest version.
- If you don't specify a tag, Ollama defaults to the model with the "latest" tag.
- Under the latest tag, you'll find details like the model's size, the beginning of the SHA-256 digest, and the age of that particular model variation.
- The right side of the tag displays the command required to run that specific version.

Understanding these tags can help you make an informed decision when choosing a model.

## Instruct Model vs Text Model

In the Ollama Library, you'll find two common types of models: instruct models and text models. Here's how they differ:

- **Instruct Model**: Designed to work with chat interfaces, these models respond to user queries in an expected manner, ensuring a smooth conversational experience.
- **Text Model**: These foundational models can be further trained by users with the necessary expertise, offering a solid base for customization and fine-tuning.

Choose between an instruct model and a text model based on your specific needs and goals.

## The Importance of Model Parameters

The size and complexity of a model are determined by its parameters. While the number of parameters gives a rough idea of memory requirements, it's not a direct correlation. For instance, an 8 billion parameter model might need around 8 GB of RAM, considering additional space for the operating system and context.

Understanding these memory requirements is crucial for optimal model performance.

## The Significance of Quantization

Quantization is key to compressing models and reducing their memory footprint. In the Ollama Library, you might see tags that start with "q" followed by a number. Here's what you need to know:

- **Quantization**: This technique compresses 32-bit floating-point numbers in the model to 4-bit integers, significantly reducing memory requirements without major performance loss.
- **q4_0**: This is often the recommended starting point, offering a good balance between memory savings and model performance.

Leveraging quantization can greatly optimize your experience with Ollama models.

## Choosing the Right Model

Selecting the perfect model can be challenging due to overlapping functionalities and unique tasks. While benchmarks can provide insights, they might not cover all use cases. The best way to find the right model is through personal testing and observing their performance in your specific scenarios.

To help you with this, our team is developing a tool that will aid in determining the ideal model for your questions. We'll also share an explanatory video on our channel soon, so make sure to subscribe for updates!

## The Layers of a Model

In Ollama, a model consists of multiple layers, each serving a distinct purpose. These layers include:

- **Parameters**: This layer includes stop parameters that instruct Ollama to disregard text beyond certain phrases.
- **Template**: Defines the format in which prompts should be provided for the model to understand. The template is based on the training process used by the model developers.

Understanding these layers is important for effectively utilizing Ollama's capabilities and tailoring your prompts for the best responses.

## Conclusion

The Ollama Library offers a diverse range of models, each with unique strengths and use cases. Whether you're looking for lightweight models for mobile applications, powerful models for complex tasks, or specialized models for coding and multimodal tasks, the Ollama Library has something to offer. By understanding the different tags, parameters, and quantization techniques, you can make an informed decision on which model best suits your needs. Remember, the best way to find the right model is through personal testing and observation in your specific scenarios.

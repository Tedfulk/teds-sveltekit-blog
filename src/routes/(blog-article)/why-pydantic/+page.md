## Why Pydantic?

Today, **Pydantic** is downloaded over **125 million times a month** and is utilized by some of the world's largest and most recognizable organizations.

### Type Hints Powering Schema Validation
Pydantic's validation schema is primarily defined by Python type hints, which are:

- Integral for developers familiar with modern Python.
- Compatible with static typing tools like `mypy` and `pyright`.
- Well-integrated with IDEs such as PyCharm and Visual Studio Code (VSCode).

### Serialization Features
Pydantic facilitates data serialization in multiple ways:

1. **To a Python Dictionary**:
   - Using associated Python objects.
   - Employing "jsonable" types.
2. **To a JSON String**:
   - Output customization includes field exclusions and handling of unset or default values.

### Strict Mode and Data Coercion
Pydantic's handling of data types includes:

- **Default Tolerance and Coercion**: Automatically converts common incorrect types (e.g., numeric strings to integers).
- **Strict Mode**: Ensures strict adherence to data types without coercion.
- **JSON Data Handling**: Capable of parsing and validating JSON, including conversion of specific strings to Python types like datetime, UUID, etc.

This combination of features explains Pydantic's popularity and widespread adoption in the programming community.

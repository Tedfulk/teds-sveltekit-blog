Welcome to the SvelteKit Blog! This project is a static blog template built with SvelteKit, designed to be fast, themeable, and easy to use.

## Features

- **Markdown Support**: Write posts in Markdown.
- **Themeable**: Easily change the website's theme.
- **Extensible**: Reusable components for building new pages.

## Writing Posts

Posts are written in Markdown and stored in the `src/routes/(blog-article)` directory. Each post has front matter for metadata.

Example front matter:

```markdown

date: "2024-03-14"
excerpt: "A brief summary of the post."
